Welcome to the **Face Swapping App** repository! This application leverages **Streamlit** and **OpenCV**, powered by **InsightFace**, to perform seamless face swapping on images and videos. Whether you want to swap faces in pictures or videos, this app provides a simple and efficient solution.

---

## Features

- **Image Face Swap**: Effortlessly swap faces between a source and target image.
- **Video Face Swap**: Apply face swapping across all frames of a target video using a source face image.
- **High Precision**: Built on **InsightFace** deep learning models for accurate face detection and swapping.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Interact with the app through a sleek and intuitive **Streamlit** interface.

## How It Works

1. **Image Face Swapping**:
   - Detects faces in both the source and target images.
   - Replaces the target face with the source face using the `inswapper_128.onnx` model.
   
2. **Video Face Swapping**:
   - Processes each frame of the video to detect and swap faces to match the source face.
